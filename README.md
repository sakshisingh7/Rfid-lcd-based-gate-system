# Rfid-lcd-based-gate-system
One of the major challenges faced all over the world is insecurity. Loss of life and  property arises from bridge of restriction to certain area has become a daily routine.  Several efforts to prevent unwanted access which ranges from key lock system to  intelligent lock system do have various degrees of limitations.
we proposed a security system contains door locking system using 
RFID. The system is implemented in three spaces using central database system. The 
system used hardware as well as software. The hardware components are RFID 
reader, tags, MSP430 and jumper wires etc. In addition we have used buzzer. The 
detail of the proposed scheme is showing below: 
 
Step 1: The RFID reader retrieve the information contains by tag as it come in the 
range of few millimeters from reader.
Step 2: after receiving the tag information, reader send this information to database 
for conformation. If it holds, the information stored for further operation. 
Step 3: The central server queries to database and retrieve corresponding information 
after receiving the query from the reader.
Step 4: Once the tag information verified, you will get access of doo
